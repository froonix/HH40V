## OpenWrt support
The device is supported by [OpenWrt 23.05](https://openwrt.org/toh/alcatel/hh40v)! ðŸ¥³

But there are still some [serious security issues](https://github.com/froonix/HH40V/wiki/OpenWrt-(23.05.0)#lte-modem-security) with the built-in LTE modem.

_DO NOT USE THE LTE MODEM (ESPECIALLY IPV6 ENABLED SIM CARDS) WITHOUT REASONABLE PRECAUTIONS!_
